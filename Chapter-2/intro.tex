\section{Introduction}\label{sec:ch2:intro}

Networked unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have emerged as an important technology for public safety, commercial, and military applications including search and rescue, disaster relief, precision agriculture, environmental monitoring, and C3ISR (i.e., command and control, communications, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance). 
However, designing, implementing, and testing UAV networks poses numerous interdisciplinary challenges because the underlying communications and networking problems cannot be explored independently of aero-mechanical, sensing, control,~~embedded systems,~~and robotics challenges. Indeed, UAV networks are fundamentally {\it cyber-physical systems}~\cite{namuduri2012airborne}.
