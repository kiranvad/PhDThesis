\chapter{Exploratory data analysis of phase diagrams}\label{chapter4}
Organic thin films made of conjugated polymers and/or small molecules have captured the interest of the organic electronics industry due to their wide range of alterable properties (e.g., the color of light emission and solubility in organic solvents). 
High-performing devices have recently been designed with a multi-component material system (as opposed to initial studies that focused on binary blends). 
This reaffirmed the need for a holistic approach to materials design beyond binary blends used to understand the mixing behavior and morphology formation during the fabrication of multi-component organic thin films.

In this chapter, we present a thermodynamics based framework to identify the suitable solvents for a solvent-based manufacturing of organic blends. We present high throughput exploration and construction of a composition-phase diagram map that captures thermodynamics characteristics and facilitates understanding of the multi-component solution's mixing behavior. Our analysis pipeline consists of (i)~a thermodynamics based model to determine phase diagrams of multi-component mixtures using the convex hull method; and (ii)~high throughput analysis of a large set of phase diagrams using dimensionality reduction coupled with the clustering. To illustrate our pipeline, we derive the design rules for material systems typically
used in organic thin films.
