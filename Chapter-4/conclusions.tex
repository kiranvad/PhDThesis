\section{Conclusions}
In this chapter, a high-throughput framework is introduced for phase diagram generation with the capabilities to evaluate for physical and computational accuracy. 
A data-analysis pipeline is used to perform initial screening of materials to identify subgroups there by decreasing the number of samples to be studied by an expert.
Applying the proposed methodology on two sets of material systems a framework is provided to derive potential design rules for solvent selection in OSC manufacturing.
