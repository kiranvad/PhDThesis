\chapter{Introduction}\label{chap:intro}
The overarching goal of our proposed research is to accelerate material discovery by injecting physics based knowledge into data driven modelling and design.
We identify representation as a key component of data-driven material discovery framework and discuss its impact on three main categories of accelerated material discovery:
\begin{itemize}
    \item {\textbf{Down selection: }Designing a strategy to select a small subset of materials for in-depth material characterization from a expert designed high-throughput search.}
    \item {\textbf{Autonomous experimental design: }Designing a strategy for data location selection to characterize material(s) of interest.}
    \item {\textbf{Property-Response detection: }Knowledge extraction from a high-throughput material discovery }
\end{itemize}
