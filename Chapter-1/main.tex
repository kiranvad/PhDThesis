\section{Motivation}\label{sec:ch1:intro}
Micro air vehicles (MAVs\footnote{We use the terms MAV, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), and drone interchangeably.}) are entering our daily life for a variety of applications including surveillance, search-and-rescue~\cite{modares-icra17}, emergency first response, package delivery, environmental monitoring, and precision agriculture.
However, designing multi-drone networks and applications poses numerous inter-disciplinary challenges because the underlying communications and networking problems cannot be explored independently from aero-mechanical, sensing, control, embedded systems, and robotics challenges~\cite{jmod2016poster, jmod2016demo}.
