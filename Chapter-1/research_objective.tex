\section*{Research Objective}
Our research objective is to identify and understand role of representation in the three tasks of accelerated material discovery; namely:~a)down selection;~b)autonomous experimental design;~c)property-response detection. Towards this we defined following research tasks. We use cyclic voltammetry responses as an example as the data is high-dimensional, complex with multiple representations possible for a task in hand.
\begin{itemize}
    \item {\textbf{Research Task 1 }\textit{Down selection:} This task focuses on building a metric representation that encodes connectivity into the structure of high-dimensional spectral data. We use a combinatorial CV dataset to understand the challenges in the context of obtaining a low-throughput of samples from an expert defined high-throughput search. With a goal to encoding compositional continuity to the high-dimensional structure of the data, we determine a multi-functional existence diagram that is both useful for down selection and property-response relation detection.}
    \item{\textbf{Research Task 2 }\textit{Autonomous knowledge extraction:} This task focuses on building stochastic or probabilistic representations of the data in the context of kinetic knowledge extraction from cyclic voltammetry. Extracting rate dependent performance measures of a catalyst is a bottleneck usually governed by unknown, complex underlying mechanisms. Extracting rate dependent performance measures of a (molecular)catalyst is typically a laborious process involving a grid search to identify "ideal" conditions to run an experiment that produces a catalyst response near its kinetic limits. We propose and show an empirical acceleration in data sampling by purely our selection strategy as a search of a particular probabilistic representation of CV curves.}
    \item{\textbf{Research Task 3 }\textit{property-response detection: } This task focuses on evaluating polymer mixtures based on their phase diagrams. We apply clustering method as an exploratory data analysis technique to the problem of solvent selection in organic solar cells.}
\end{itemize}
