Materials design and discovery through the high-throughput exploration of materials space has been recognized as a new paradigm in materials science. However, typical high-throughput exploration methods deliver high-dimensional and very diverse data sets that pose the challenge of extracting the key features and patterns that could guide the discovery process. Unraveling patterns is a non-trivial task as quite often the underlying physical phenomena are uncertain and latent variables governing the performance are mainly unknown. 

We develop techniques to understand materials properties in an accelerated fashion. 
Our approach involves building physics infused representations for multi-variate correlative study of diverse set of data sets including cyclic voltammetry and phase diagrams. 
This thesis highlights that identifying suitable representations of data for down stream analysis plays an important role.
